**Clicks per Second (CPS)** is a measure of how many times a person can click a mouse button (or tap a screen) within one second. It's often used in online games, challenges, and tests to measure how fast someone can perform clicking actions. CPS tests are especially popular among gamers in competitive games where fast clicking can give an advantage, like in **Minecraft**, **FPS games**, or other action-heavy games.

### How CPS is Calculated:
CPS = Total Number of Clicks / Time (in seconds)

For example:
- If you click 50 times in 10 seconds, your CPS would be: CPS = 50/10 = 5 clicks per second

### Popular Uses of CPS:
1. **Gaming:** Players use CPS to gain speed advantages in games where rapid clicking is key (e.g., building, attacking, or crafting).
2. **Competitions:** Some websites offer CPS tests as fun challenges, like "How many clicks can you do in 5 seconds?"
3. **Skill Measurement:** It's a fun way to measure hand-eye coordination and speed.

The average CPS for most people is around **6-7 CPS**, but skilled players or those using special techniques (like jitter or butterfly clicking) can achieve much higher rates, such as **10-15 CPS** or more.
